## Description

I've been thinking about the question "What is research software" and think it would be fun to create an "Is it research software" interface. It would be akin to Hot or Not, but instead of people, show research software projects. It should work:

 - to render content on GitHub pages from static files in some repository
 - allow for voting to keep track of the totals (this is the hard part, we'd need some database that we can interact with safely on GitHub pages, and this might not be possible, in which case an actual app to run on a cloud would work too!)

This is something I am adding here also to test the "needs-love" interface and automation that I'm currently developing. This will eventually work so people can post projects / ideas like this, and it will update to the web interface over night, and then when someone is assigned / or the matched label is added (meaning someone found it on the interface and wants to help) it will parse on a different spot on the site.

I'll likely be using this issue to test a bunch of stuffs!
