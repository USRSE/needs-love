## Description

Exosphere: is an experimental, researcher-friendly interface for managing cloud compute workloads. 

It is a pure client application that uses the same technologies as the popular communication tool Slack (Electron). Instead of JavaScript the software is written in a statically typed, pure functional programming language called Elm (https://elm-lang.org/) which ensures no runtime exceptions, and which makes refactoring a breeze.Exosphere communicates with OpenStack services via open, standard REST (HTTP) APIs. The same codebase is usable in a web browser (https://try.exosphere.app) or as a desktop application (https://try.exosphere.app/packages/). 

Exosphere is designed to be used with any OpenStack cloud with zero custom integration. The cloud administrator usually does not need to do anything except provide access to the standard OpenStack APIs. 

## How can we help?

In collaboration with Jetstream Cloud we launched a prototype of Exosphere that allows users to access their Jetstream resources.We are looking for people who are interested in learning Elm, and who want to help researchers leverage cloud computing resources.Repository: https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere
